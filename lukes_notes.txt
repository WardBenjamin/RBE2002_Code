Driving Chassis:

+ distanceToWheelAngle(float distance) 
	-> converts a linear distance into the amount of rotations needed

+ chassisRotationToWheelDistance(float angle)
	-> takes in a angle and calculates the arc length necessary
	
+ driveForward(mmDistanceFromCurrent, msDuration)
	-> takes in a disance and a time that the action should take
	-> somehow makes the motor moves
	
	
myleft->overrideCurrentPosition(0) will zero out the moto for relative moves otherwise
it is in absolute mode
